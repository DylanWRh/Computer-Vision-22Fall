# Seismic Phase Picking

This is a group work and another contributor is ***Yuchen Wang***.

Our task is to do seismic phase picking and more details can be seen in the [document](https://yzhu.io/s/research/cv/phasepicking/).

We have to say it is eventually an **uncompleted** (or absolutely failed in a harsher way) work as our models cannot converge correctly and cannot give any prediction. There must be some bugs in the source code we failed to figure out. 

Anyway, it is our first attempt to build and train such large models on such a large dataset. We still get a lot to learn from the failure and that is the reason the code is saved here, for future revision and possible bug fixing.
