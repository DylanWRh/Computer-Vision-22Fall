For details, see the [report](https://github.com/DylanWRh/Computer-Vision-22Fall/raw/main/02-panorama/Report.pdf) for this assignment. (and u will realize that my English level is as disappointing as my coding style)

# Usage

Run `stitching.py` to stitch 2 (example) images.

To experiment on your own image, tune image path in the source code of `stitching.py` and/or `panorama.py`.
